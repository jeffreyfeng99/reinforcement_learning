## Experimentation with reinforcement learning 

Design for a generalized framework with options for double dqn, duel dqn, and prioritized experience replays.

### Scripts
* run.py - main facilitation of training and testing (hyperparameters are set here)
* options.py - object for storage of parameters (parameters and model requirements vary between environments)
* memory.py - structures for storing experiences in a memory replay (both standard queue and prioritized experience replay)

* conv_agent.py
* agent.py
